*Meson build for LuaJIT 2*

This repository mirrors the source code for LuaJIT 2 with the addition of a Meson build.

You can find more information about LuaJIT in the [LuaJIT's homepage](http://luajit.org/).

It covers both the 2.0 and 2.1 versions of LuaJIT.
The version 2.0 is in the `master` branch while the version 2.1 is in the `v2.1` branch.

## Why Meson ?

Because it is better than Makefiles and works better with [Little Library Helper](https://github.com/franko/lhelper) to easily build and install LuaJIT on Linux or Windows.

One of the practical reason that pushed me to write a Meson build for LuaJIT was that the .pc files installed with the original Makefiles was installed in the wrong directory on Debian. Even more important, the Makefile is not accurate when it comes to install the library.

## How to use it?

From the source directory:

```sh
meson setup build
ninja -C build
ninja -C build install
```
